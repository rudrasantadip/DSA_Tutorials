/**
 *Peak element is defined as that element that is greater than both of its neighbors. 
 If 'arr[i]' is the peak element, 'arr[i - 1]' < 'arr[i]' and 'arr[i + 1]' < 'arr[i]'.
Assume 'arr[-1]' and 'arr[n]' as negative infinity.
Note:
1.  There are no 2 adjacent elements having same value (as mentioned in the constraints).
2.  Do not print anything, just return the index of the peak element (0 - indexed).
3. 'True'/'False' will be printed depending on whether your answer is correct or not.
Example:
Input: 'arr' = [1, 8, 1, 5, 3]
